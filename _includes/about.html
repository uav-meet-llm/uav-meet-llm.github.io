        <p class="text-faded">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now widely deployed in logistics, forestry, and military operations, with multimodal large models driving transformative advances in human-uav collaboration, particularly in visual-language navigation. </p>
        <p class="text-faded">This workshop explores cutting-edge integration of UAV systems with large language models (LLMs) through three pivotal innovations: 1) An end-to-end framework converting language commands directly into low-level control signals (velocity, heading), bypassing traditional hierarchical control layers to achieve precise maneuver execution. 2) A cognitive engine enabling multi-level mission breakdown, supporting both single-drone operations and multi-UAV coordination in dynamic scenarios. 3) A digital twin system integrating multimodal data synthesis and physical verification, enabling closed-loop training from language interpretation to flight control. This workshop aims to systematically address technical bottlenecks, chart development roadmaps, and drive paradigm shifts in intelligent UAV systems.</p>
        <p class="text-faded">The technical insights and solutions emerging from this workshop are expected to inject new momentum into UAV intelligence, accelerating the evolution of next-generation human-uav collaborative ecosystems.</p>
